                        text: "We are still allowing proposals written from other rich text processing software such as **Apple (iWork) Pages**, **LibreOffice Writer**, as well as **(Kingsoft) WPS Writer**, as long as the proposal is submitted in PDF format with the specified guidelines. This means that you do **not** need to worry about the file formats used for saving your working draft (.DOC, .DOCX, .ODT, .WPS, etc.)"

                        text: "The zip archive **must** include evidences for **all the team leader and members**, and this means you only need to upload evidences once without requiring other team members to upload the same evidences on the payment page. **If you decide to re-upload the file, the older version of the uploaded file will be overriden and no longer available for us to review.**"

                        text: "When scanning and uploading Student ID Card, please make sure that you and your team members' **university name**, **student identification number**, and the **full name** are clearly visible.
