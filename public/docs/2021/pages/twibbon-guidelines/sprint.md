Hola!
.
My name is (....) and I will be participating in the COMPUTERUN 2.0 Virtual Run Competition! 🏃
.
Life is better in running shoes, so I guess It’s time to move my legs as I am ready to SPRINT! With the aim to help me develop and maintain a healthier lifestyle through running during this pandemic. Remember, it doesn’t matter the distance as long as you do it, it will count! 👣
