                text: "This guidebook is intended for participants wishing to compete on all of our competitions as well as our [UI/UX workshop](/info/workshop). While participants for other events are **not** required to upload their twibbon to be eligible for participating in the respective events, we would like to encourage them in participating to raise awareness of COMPUTERUN 2.0 as an international event."

                text: "Since both competitions, as well as the entire **COMPUTERUN 2.0** event, will be held internationally, we acknowledge that there will be some edge cases where eligible participants are unable to submit twibbons according to our general guidelines and requirements. If this is the case for you, please contact us through our **LINE Official Account** at **[@995bowex](https://line.me/R/ti/p/@995bowex)** or by emailing to **[computerun2.0@gmail.com](mailto:computerun2.0@gmail.com)** before the start of the competition."
